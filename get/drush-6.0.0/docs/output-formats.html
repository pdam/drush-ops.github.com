<h1>Drush Output Formats</h1>
<p>
Some Drush commands produce output that may be rendered in a variety
of different ways using a pluggable formatting system.  Drush commands
that support output formats will show a --format option in their
help text.  The available formats are also listed in the help text,
along with the default value for the format option.  The list of values
shown is abreviated; to see the complete list of available formats, run
the help command with the --verbose option.
<p>
The --pipe option is equivalent to using --format=&lt;pipe-format&gt;;
note that pipe format varies by command.  The pipe format will be shown
in the options section of the command help, under the --pipe option. For
historic reasons, --pipe also hides all log messages.
<p>
To best understand how the various Drush output formatters work,
it is best to first look at the ouput of the command using the
'export' format.  This will show the result of the command using
the exact structure that was built by the command, without any
reformatting.  This is the "standard format" for the Drush command.
Different formatters will take this information and present it in
different ways.
