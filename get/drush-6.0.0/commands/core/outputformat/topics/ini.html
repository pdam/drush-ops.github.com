The 'ini' formatter will convert an associative array into a textual
representation that can be parsed with the php function parse_ini_file()
or parse_ini_string().  The source array should be a simple associative
array of key: value pairs; however, it is also possible to format an
associative array of the same kind used by the 'table' formatter if the
Drush command defines which column of the table should serve as the
'value' data.
<p>
The command `drush core-requirements`, when called with the --pipe option,
will use the 'ini' formatter to produce its output.  The output format
record in the core-requirements command definition array contains an
entry 'ini-item' => 'sid'; this indicates that the field 'sid' should appear
as the data item in the ini format's output.
<p>
<i>$ drush core-requirements --pipe</i>
<pre>
cron: 2
drupal: -1
</pre>
(Note: the output above has been shortened for clarity; the actual output
of core-requirements contains additional rows not shown here.)
<p>
For an example of code that would produce the output above, please see
the example shown in the 'table' formatter.
