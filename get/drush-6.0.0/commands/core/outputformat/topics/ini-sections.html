The 'ini-sections' formatter is similar to the 'ini' formatter; it too will
produce formatted output that may be parsed by the php functions
parse_ini_file() or parse_ini_string().  The difference between these
two formatters is that 'ini-sections' will also include section headers
between square brackets (i.e., "[section]").  This is ideal for commands
that produce multiple 'ini' format sections, each stored as the value in
a row of an associative array where the keys define the section label.
<p>
The command `pm-list`, when called with the --pipe option, is an example of
a command that produces output using the 'ini-sections' formatter.
<p>
<i>$ drush pm-info devel environment_indicator --pipe</i>
<p>
<pre>
[devel]
extension=devel
required_by=devel_generate, devel_themer, ds_devel

[environment_indicator]
extension=environment_indicator
required_by=
</pre>
(Note: the output above has been shortened for clarity; the actual output
of pm-info contains additional rows not shown here.)
<p>
For an example of code that would produce the output above, please see
the example shown in the 'key-value-list' formatter.
